## 1. Create a Project

- **The cleanest way:** Use Microsoft‘s `dotnet console` command

First on Windows:

- Open your Command Line. `Command Prompt` or short: `cmd.exe`
- You can use `cd` to check in what directory you are right now
- First, use `cd C:\Projects\` to move to the desired folder (exchange `C:` with another hard drive partition, if you like.
  - `cd` stands for change directory
  - if that directory does not exist, yet...
  - either use `mkdir C:\Projects\` to create said directory through the Command Prompt
    - `mkdir` stands for make directory
  - or create it manually through the `File Explorer`

First on Mac:

- Open your Command Line. On Mac/Linux: `Terminal`
- You can use `pwd` to check in what directory you are right now
  - `pwd` stands for print working directory
- First, use `cd ~/Projects/` to move to the desired folder
  - `cd` stands for change directory
  - if that directory does not exist, yet...
  - either use `mkdir ~/Projects/` to create said directory through the Terminal
  - or create it manually through `Finder`

For Both (Windows and Mac):

- When you see that you are in the directory where you would like to create your project:
  - Then use `dotnet new console –o HelloWorld` to create a new C# console project named `HelloWorld`

- You might want to validate its existence by opening your `File Explorer` (Windows) or `Finder` (Mac)
  - and then navigate to the folder that you have specified in the second step of these instructions

---

## 2. Run the Project

- Move to the newly created project folder: `cd HelloWorld`
- note that paths, that start with a `/` on Mac or `\` on Windows (or `C:\`) are called absolute paths.
  - they reference from the root directory, so if you type `/HelloWorld`, then it looks for a `HelloWorld`-Folder directly on the root of your hard drive
- paths, that do not start with a slash or backslash, are called relative paths
  - they reference from whatever working directory you are in right now
    - so if you type `HelloWorld` and you are in `C:\Projects`, it will look for `C:\Projects\HelloWorld`
    - if you type `HelloWorld` and you are in `D:\Stuff`, it will look for `D:\Stuff\HelloWorld`
- Use the command `dotnet run` to run your new application
- Observe the output:

- We are done!
- The machines are truly stealing our jobs!

## 3. Let's have a look at all the files that were created

- `HelloWorld.csproj` – This is our C#-Project file *(short: csproj)*
- `Program.cs` – This is our only C#-Script for this Project
- `obj` – This is a temporary directory used by the compiler while building *(short for object)*
- `bin` – This is where our Binary is built to *(short for binary)*

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134818821-f85d79b8-bb69-43f8-92a2-b0d5fa5f1d53.png" width="400" height="300">

---

## 4. `HelloWorld.csproj`

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
</Project>
```

- XML-Format
- Contains a Project using `Microsoft.Net`
- The Output-Type is an *Executable*
  - This is a program that can be executed on its own
- Target Framework is `net5.0`
  - It is the most current framework right now

---

## 5. `Program.cs`

```cs
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }
  }
}
```

- 13 Lines of Code for some Console Output.
- Let‘s go through this Line by Line:
- **What‘s that?**

```cs

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
```

---

## 6. About `using` and `namespace`

#### What is a Namespace?
- **Imagine this:**
- You are using two Frameworks in your project. They both contain a class named `Job`.

<sub>This is one framework called ECS</sub>
```cs
public class Job {
  public string name;
  public object handle;
}
```

<sub>This is another framework called OOP</sub>
```cs
public class Job {
  public int id;
  public object handle;
  
}
```
- How do you address each class now?
- They have the same name...
- *Hint: It often won‘t even compile.*

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134821346-0e83f055-fbca-4b0f-b0be-e7459d0716c0.png" width="400" height="100">

---

## 7. Solution: Namespaces

- If they both have their own namespace, everything will work just fine.

<sub>This is one framework called ECS</sub>
```cs
namespace ECS {
  public class Job {
    public string name;
    public object handle;
  }
}  
```

<sub>This is another framework called OOP</sub>
```cs
namespace OOP { 
  public class Job {
    public int id;
    public object handle;
  }
}
```

---

## 8. How to use Classes in Namespaces

- Either fully address them
```cs
public static void Main() {
  var job = new OOP.Job();
}
```
- Or Add a using Statement to the beginning of your file *(this will allow you to use ALL classes
 within that namespace without addressing them)*
```cs
using OOP;
public class Program {
  public static void Main() {
    var job = new Job();
  }
}
```
- Or add a specific using Statement to the beginning of your file
```cs
using Job = OOP.Job;
public class Program {
  public static void Main() {
    var job = new Job();
  }
}
```


---

## 9. Nesting Namespaces

- You can, and should, nest your namespaces
- **Rule of thumb:**
  - Every Folder in your project should have ist own namespace
  - Its namespace should be nested in the parent folder‘s namespace

- You can nest namespaces by putting them inside of each other
```cs
namespace ECS {
  namespace Jobs {
    public class Job {...}
  }
  namespace Math {
    public class Vector {...}
  }
}
```
- Or by separating them by `.`
```cs
namespace ECS.Jobs {
  public class Job {
    public string name;
    public object handle;
  }
}
```
- You can use the `using` keyword on nested Namespaces, too.
```cs
using ECS.Jobs;
```


---

## 10. Curly Braces

- Curly Braces always define a scope. 
- `{` marks the start of a scope
  - Everything inbetween is part of that scope
- `}` marks the end of the scope
- **They are used for:**
  - Namespaces
  - Classes
  - Methods
  - Loops
  - … and many more!
- Every opening bracket `{` needs a closing bracket `}`
- Everything inbetween is part of the scope
- They can be nested

```cs
namespace HelloWorld
{                 // namespace scope begins
  class Program
  {               // class scope begins
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {             // void method scope begins
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }             // void method scope ends
  }               // class scope ends
}                 // namespace scope ends
```

---

## 11. Program.cs 2

```cs
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  ```
  
- So, what‘s happening here, then?
- We‘re using `.Net`‘s `System` Namespace, that contains tons of useful classes, including the `Console`-class.
- Then, we‘re creating our own namespace, like every good software should do ☺

---

## 12. Program.cs 3

```cs
class Program
{
  ```
  
- Next, a Class called `Program` is defined.
- It is **not** required to have a Class with the exact name `Program`.
- It has only become a standard to call the Main-Class `Program`.
- The class could have any name, though!

---

## 13. OOP

- `C#` is an object-oriented language
- Procedural programming languages, like C, build the whole application defining and calling functions
```cpp
void OpenHouseDoor(int houseId) {}
void CloseHouseDoor(int houseId) {}
int GetNeighbourHouse(int houseId) {}
void CreateHouse(int houseId) {}

void main()  {
  CreateHouse(1);
  OpenHouseDoor(1);
  OpenHouseDoor(GetNeighbourHouse(1));
}
```
- In Object-Oriented languages, you design your code using objects.
- Instead of having an `OpenHouseDoor`-Method, you would have a `House`-Object with an `OpenDoor`-Method.
```cs
class House {
  public void OpenDoor(){}
  public void CloseDoor(){}
  public House GetNeighbour(){}
}

void Main() {
  var house = new House();
  house.OpenDoor();
  house.CloseDoor();
  house.GetNeighbour().OpenDoor();
}
```


---

## 14. Classes & Objects

- Classes are types. Templates for Objects.
- Objects are instances of those classes.
- Objects inherit all code that the class provides.
- So, if a Car-Class has a `Drive()`-Method
- Then both `volvo.Drive()` and `audi.Drive()`
- Are valid function calls

```cs
class Fruit {}
class Car {}

static void Main() {
  var apple = new Fruit();
  var banana = new Fruit();
  var mango = new Fruit();
  var volvo = new Car();
  var audi = new Car();
}
```

---

## 15. Classes & Objects 2

```cs
// Beginning of class definition
class car {
  // This is where the contents of the class belong
} // End of the class definition
```

- You define a class by using the Keyword `class`
- Followed by the `name of the class`
- Followed by Curly Braces `{`
- Followed by the `contents of you class`
- Followed by Curly Braces `}`

---

## 16. Program.cs 4

- Next, a static method called `Main` is defined.
- It has one parameter named args of type `string[]`
- A static method called `Main`, with this (or no) Parameter, will be the entry point of your application. 
- The return type may be `void`, or also `int` (Exit Code), or `Task`, or `Task<int>` (Async).
- The parameter `string[] args` can be omitted.

```cs
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
     
 ```
      

---

## 17. Program.cs 5

```cs
  
  Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
  
```
  
- `Console`-Class‘s `WriteLine`-Method is called.
- The local string-value `Hello World!` is defined and passed as `value`-Argument.
- `WriteLine` is a static method, therefor, it can be accessed directly through the class.

```cs
public static void WriteLine(string value)
```

---

## 18. Isn't that amount of code a little too much?
  
#### It sure is!

- First, we‘re not using the Arguments from the Main-Method
- So we can just as well leave them out

```cs
using System;
  
namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
  }
}
```
  <br></br>
  
- Next, we don‘t need a Namespace for our `Program`-Class
- Since there is no other `Program`-Class in the `::global` Namespace
  
```cs
using System;
class Program
{
  static void Main()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
  }
}
```
  
  <br></br>
  
- Since we are only using classes within the `System`-Namespace once, we can 
  instead of `using` the whole Namespace, just fully qualify the `Console`-Class
  
```cs
 class Program
{
  static void Main()
  {
    System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
  }
}
```
 
 <br></br> 

- We can further shorten the syntax by using
- C#‘s expression body syntax
- Where instead of putting the method body between `{}`
- We can put one line of code behind `=>`

```cs
class Program
{
  static void Main() => System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```

<br></br>

- **Actually…**
- Since `.NET 5`, we don‘t even need to specify a `class` with a `Main` Method anymore
- For simple programs, we can just write the code we want to execute 
- Outside of a `class`:

```cs
System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```
---

## 19. Now, this is what I call a proper "Hello World!"

```cs
System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```
